# Brief

In this project, we're creating a Pomodoro timer.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.

**Users should be able to:**

- Start the timer by clicking on the start link/button.
- Once the user clicks start, the word start will change to stop.
- Add window prompts from customizable minutes and seconds for the timer to start.
- Once the timer finishes, the ring should change from green to red and an alert message is passed to the browser.

# Getting Started

1. Open the project's `README.md` file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
2. Customize your project / file architecture to your liking.
3. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofjs**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla JavaScript.
- Take a step back and try writing the HTML and CSS for this project yourself. Start with the provided Figma file. If you get stuck, you can always purchase the Advent of CSS solutions, where Amy explains how to build this.
- When the timer is completed, play the alert sound. (Audio file included)
